### 🛠️ The Work
I am an engineer and founder focused on **systems architecture** and **AI efficiency**.
Currently building **[XiteAI](https://xiteai.com)**, a unified intelligence layer designed to solve the fragmentation between major LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

My goal is simple: **Build tools that respect the user's time and intelligence.**

---

### 🔭 Current Engineering Focus
* **The "Maestro" Router:** Developing a proprietary logic layer that dynamically routes queries to the most cost-effective model (Gemini vs. Llama vs. GPT-4) without user intervention.
* **Unit Economics:** Engineered a "Gym Membership" financial model that sustains a 66% margin while offering premium compute at ₹599/month.
* **Privacy Architecture:** Implementing local-first storage and "Zero Data Retention" protocols to serve privacy-conscious developers and researchers.

---

### 🧠 Philosophy & Approach
* **Resourcefulness > Resources:** Built the entire XiteAI backend and local MVP on zero funding by architecting around API limitations (e.g., custom routing layers).
* **Polymathic Development:** I believe in cross-discipline mastery. I don't just write code; I design the UI, calculate the financials, and engineer the physical infrastructure concepts (TerraSweep).
* **Binary Commitment:** I don't do "projects." I build companies.

---

### 📈 The Ecosystem
Beyond XiteAI, I am architecting a roadmap of 13 interconnected ventures, including:
* **Suraksha Hetu:** A decentralized safety network.
* **Ella OS:** A context-aware operating system layer.
* **TerraSweep:** Autonomous urban infrastructure robotics.
